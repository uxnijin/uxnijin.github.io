                    <p>As the Head of Design at Modular AI, my team is going from 0 to 1 on a lot of AI products and workflows this year. Even though I’ve been designing for developers for years, I’ve personally had to quickly ramp up on some AI specific topics and build out our personas, so I thought I’d share a few best practices and top references I’ve established for myself.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="font-semibold">Guiding UI principles:</p>
                    <p>Condensed information is welcomed. Much like the B2B industries of data science and fintech, these personas welcome dense data — as well as it’s designed with a strong hierarchy. So, reduce those margins!<br>Parsed metadata is the most clear. Extracting out the metadata and making it search/filter/sortable is important. Tables, side drawers, tagging systems — these are the main design system elements to refine.<br>Remember Jakob’s law — user’s spend more time on other sites than your own. There are strong leaders in AI, such as HuggingFace and OpenAI. If they’ve established a pattern and there’s no strong reason to deviate, go with it. I know, I know, this goes against first principles, but there’s a time and a place for first principles. I’lll leave it to you to decide that for your team and roadmap.<br>A great sources for designing for developers is Github’s design system. Here are a few of their principles that are clearly custom to the developer persona:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast<br>Anything added dilutes everything else<br>Practicality beats purity<br>Approachable is better than simple<br>Half measures are as bad as nothing at all<br>Encourage flow<br>Favor focus over features</p>

                    <p>So with those principles in mind here are some key interfaces that my team has released this year. Keep in mind my team is 4 people (2 designers & 2 developers), and we’re a fast-paced start-up. Our designs are all released as MVPs at first, then iterated once live, and often built off of existing systems to get from 0 to 1 and get real external validation as fast as possible. All of the designs in this post were created by myself and Will Rust together. Design is a team sport.</p>
